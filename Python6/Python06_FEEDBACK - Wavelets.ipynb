    "We can use the Fourier Transform to  transform a signal from its time-domain to its frequency domain. The peaks in the frequency spectrum indicate the most occurring frequencies in the signal. The larger and sharper a peak is, the more prevalent a frequency is in a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about the Fourier Transform is that it has a high resolution in the frequency-domain but zero resolution in the time-domain. This means that it can tell us exactly which frequencies are present in a signal, but not at which location in time these frequencies have occurred. This can easily be demonstrated as follows:\n",

    "In the above Figure, we can see at the top left a signal containing four different frequencies (4, 30, 60 and 90 Hz) which are present at all times and on the right its frequency spectrum. In the bottom figure, we can see the same four frequencies, only the first one is present in the first quarter of the signal, the second one in the second quarter, etc. In addition, on the right side we again see its frequency spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to note here is that the two frequency spectra contain exactly the same four peaks, so it can not tell us where in the signal these frequencies are present. The Fourier Transform can not distinguish between the first two signals.\n",

    "The Wavelet Transform uses a series of functions called wavelets, each with a different scale.The main difference is that the sine-wave is not localized in time while a wavelet is localized in time. This allows the wavelet transform to obtain time-information in addition to frequency information.\n",

    "Another difference between the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform is that there are many different families (types) of wavelets. The wavelet families differ from each other since for each family a different trade-off has been made in how compact and smooth the wavelet looks like. This means that we can choose a specific wavelet family which fits best with the features we are looking for in our signal.\n",
