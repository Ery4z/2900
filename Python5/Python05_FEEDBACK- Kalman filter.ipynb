    "The above expressions depend on the speed in a nonlinear manner. The traditional Kalman filter that has been used so far can not properly takes nonlinear forces into account. The required state model must be of the form $x_{k+1} = Ax_k + Bu_k + Gw_k$ where the future state only linearly depends on the previous one, and where the terms $Bu_k + Gw_k$ are independent of $x_k$. The expression of the drag force can not be captured by such state model. \n",

    "Nb: since the EKF and UKF have not been covered during the lecture, this exercise is left as 'challenge'. You will have to search in the litterature/on the web to find out how to implement these filters. Here are a few potential webpages: \n",
